- One tablespoon of minced/ground meat

## Pizza Crust

### Mix the pizza dough

1. Sieve the plain flour into a clean, dry bowl. The bowl should be large enough for mixing the flour and other ingredients. It is required to sift the flour because it airs the flour and breaks up any available lumps, making it easier to mix.
2. Add the yeast to the dry flour and stir to mix. This is important so the salt, which is added next, does not touch the yeast.
3. Put in the sugar and salt and mix thoroughly
4. Add the olive oil and mix thoroughly
5. Begin adding the warm water and mix it up with a spatula at the same time till all the water has been engrossed. Then continue by hand till even soft dough is achieved. Fold up the dough and lay it in the bowl.
6. Cover the bowl with a thin plastic film or warm towel and place it in a warm place for an hour for the dough to rise. You can place it in a turned-off oven that can serve as a warm place.

## Prepare the oven tray

Place the pizza in an oven tray. If you happen to have a pizza stone, feel free to use that instead.
The pizza will be placed in an oven tray and baked in a standard kitchen oven.

### Instructions

1. Rub some margarine in the oven tray, and ensure that every part of the tray is covered with a thin layer of margarine. Soft butter can be an alternative here
2. Sprinkle some flour on it; ensure that the flour covers all the margarine. When done, pour out the excess flour.

## Continue with the Pizza dough

### Instructions

7. After an hour, bring out the pizza dough from the warm place. The pizza dough will look swollen.
8. Knead it for a bit and move it to the oven tray.
9. In a circular motion, spread the dough until it is 12 inches in diameter. The dough may resist as you do this but continue you can get the dough to spread as wide as possible.
10. Cover the dough and place it in a warm place to rise yet again for 45 minutes.

## Prepare the Pizza toppings

### Instructions

1. While waiting for the Pizza dough to rise a second time, go on and wash the vegetables used for the pizza topping, slice them, and set aside
2. Fry the minced beef in a small quantity of vegetable oil until it turns pale.
3. Get the tomato sauce ready for the pizza. Here we made use of stock cube, onion powder salt, and some Tomato stews i.e. fresh tomato puree fried in vegetable oil. Add the stock cube, onion powder, and salt to the vegetable oil. You can also add any ingredient of your choice.

## Back to the Pizza dough

### Instructions

1. Bring out the puffed dough from the oven and spread it out more to manipulate it again
2. Spread some more olive oil on the dough.
3. Add the tomato sauce.
4. Sprinkle the cheese on top.

## Back to Baking

### Instructions

1. Place the pizza in a preheated oven (180°C or 360F) and bake for 20-25 minutes or till the pizza crust is light brown and the cheese has turned watery by the heat.
2. The pizza should be removed from the oven and place the rest of the toppings on top.
3. Place it back in the oven and bake for a maximum of 2 minutes; of course, you do not want the vegetables to become dull.

Enjoy with a chilled soft drink.

# Chicken Tikka Masala Pizza

This is an easy and delicious pizza recipe. It’s full of those classic tikka masala flavors that you know and love. The exotic flavors of chicken tikka masala pair wonderfully with the ooey-gooey cheesiness of a pizza. It’s an incredible combination of spices and rich cheese. Although this recipe has a long list of ingredients, it’s worth it and It’s not difficult to make.

# Old Forge Double Crust Stuffed White Pizza

![Old Forge Double Crust Stuffed White Pizza](images/Double-Crust-White-Pizza-Recipe)

Old Forge Double Crust White Pizza is something native to Northeast Pennsylvania. NEPA (Where I’m from) has so many different types of pizza. Also known as “Stuffed Pizza” to some, this pizza is essentially a giant (and delicious) grilled cheese sandwich! It is flavorful to the extreme, great for gatherings and parties, and very versatile. It also happens to be very easy to make from simple ingredients from the grocery store.

## Tools Needed

1. Pizza Pan or Cookie Sheet.

2. Pizza Cutter.

3. Cheese Shredder.

## Ingredients

- 2 pieces of premade Pizza Dough 16 oz each – you can make your own, really any recipe can work for this. The amount of dough you use will depend on the size of your pan and the desired thickness.

- Cheese 16 oz to 32 oz – I prefer any combination of brick, mozzarella, cheddar, and Cooper cheeses shredded and blended in equal parts. Some like to use American, muenster, and other cheeses. Your imagination is really the limit here! Use as much or as little cheese as you like, but I wouldn’t recommend going over 2 lbs as it will be difficult to eat!

- Olive Oil 2 to 3 tablespoons – Olive oil is used to coat the top crust to give it some extra flavor, color, and crispiness.

- Seasonings – I like to season the cheese inside with granulated garlic, black pepper, and oregano. I generally use the same granulated garlic, black pepper, and oregano on top as well but always add ground/crushed rosemary to add aroma and flavor that works perfectly. You can use any seasoning you like.

- Crisco, Lard, or Butter – this is used to coat the pan before making the pizza so that it doesn’t stick, has more flavor, and is crispy. If you have a non-stick pan and want to skip this for health or preference, you don’t really need it.

- Toppings (Optional) – thinly sliced onions placed on top of the crust are the most popular topping on this pizza. You can add really anything inside the crust. Broccoli, tomato, onions, spinach, peppers, steak, sausage, and pepperoni are all great to add.

## Instructions: How to Make the Double Crust White Pizza

1. Prep the Pan and Dough.

2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

3. Grease the pan with shortening, lard, or butter. I like solids, not oils because they are more tacky and help pin the dough in the corners and sides so the dough doesn’t “snap back” and shrink.

4. Roll Out the first Dough and Put in the Pan. Always use room-temperature dough for this step. Take it out of the fridge for 30 to 60 minutes before using. You can use your hands or a rolling pin to press out the dough on the counter to a size just a tiny bit smaller than the size of the pan.

5. Carefully lift up the dough and fit it into the pan, pressing it lightly and evenly into the sides and corners of the pan. If the dough shrinks and pulls away from the sides of the pan, cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit for 15 minutes, then come back and press it out to the edges.

6. Add the Cheese. You’ll want to add a generous amount of cheese to the pizza. Although amounts will differ by pan and preference, I like to have a 1-inch high flat pile of cheese uniformly spread across the pizza leaving about 1 finger-width (1/2 inch or so) from the edge of the pan.

7. Season the Cheese. Using the seasonings from the list above, sprinkle seasoning on the cheese. This is an important step as it provides flavor to what will be a very thick and heavy pizza.

8. Get Cheesy and Add Second Crust.

9. Roll Out the second dough and cover the pizza. Using the same process as in step 3, roll out the dough to just about the size of the pan and lift and set on top of the cheese. Pull out the corners of the dough and stick them to the bottom dough first. Then pull out the sides and stick them to the bottom dough going around the whole perimeter until the whole top is stuck to the bottom dough. Pinch a hole in the center of the top crust to allow air to be released. Use the handle of a pizza cutter (or serving spoon, or other similar kitchen tool) to press down the edge crust.

10. Brush with Oil and Season. Drizzle oil oil on top and spread with clean hands or a basting brush. You want to use just enough to where the whole crust is covered and shiny, but there should not be any excess pooling of oil.

11. Sprinkle seasonings on top.

## Bake and Enjoy

1. Bake at 450 degrees. Many recipes post the baking time for pizzas, I choose not to because I find every oven is different and the size and thickness of the pizza you will be preparing will vary. This pizza will take somewhere between 18 and 22 minutes to bake.

2. Look for 2 things to ensure that it is done: the crust has a deep golden brown color, and the cheese can be visibly bubbling through the small hole that you pinched in the top of the crust in step 6.

3. Rotate the pizza after 10 minutes of baking to ensure that it browns and cooks evenly.

4. ENJOY!

Certainly! Let's dive deeper into the extended description of the Savory Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza with Balsamic Glaze:
