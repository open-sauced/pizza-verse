# Style Guide

Welcome to the Pizza Verse!  This document is a general style to help you format your PR. Following it will ensure that it’s presented at its best, just using the highest quality of ingredients to the best pizza! 😊

## Headings

* Only use the `h1` tags if you’re creating a new file.
* Main titles should use the `h2` tag(e.g., ## Toppings)
* Sub-titles should use the `h3` tag (e.g., ### Types of Pepperoni)
* Headings should be written in Title case.

### Lists

* When describing the ingredients for a recipe, create unordered lists using asterisks (*).  
* When describing the recipes’ steps, create ordered lists using regular numbers and   periods after them

### Links

* Use this syntax for links to webpages: `![alt text](url)]`.
* If you'd like to link hosted files such as images, or GIFs, please upload them to the [images folder](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/tree/main/images).  Said images should be linked to using the following url: "<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/main/images/>" followed by the image’s name.
* Avoid linking to sites such as Wikipedia due to its lack of quality control.
