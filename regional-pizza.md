## Ohio Valley Pizza

Ohio Valley pizza, also known as Steubenville-style pizza or cold-topping pizza, is a unique style of pizza that originates from the Ohio Valley region, particularly Steubenville, Ohio. Here are some key characteristics of Ohio Valley pizza:

* Baked Crust First: Unlike traditional pizzas where toppings are added before baking, Ohio Valley pizza is first baked with just the crust and tomato sauce.
* Cold Toppings: After the crust and sauce are baked, cold toppings like cheese, pepperoni, and other desired ingredients are added on top. The heat from the crust slightly melts the cheese, but the toppings largely remain cold or at room temperature.
* Rectangular Shape: Typically rectangular in shape and often sold by the slice.
* Crispy Crust: The crust is usually chewy and crispy, providing a nice contrast to the cold toppings.
Served Immediately: Due to its unique preparation method, Ohio Valley pizza is best enjoyed immediately after it's made to experience the contrast of hot crust and cold toppings.

This style of pizza is beloved by many in the Ohio Valley region and has a dedicated following. It offers a different pizza-eating experience, with the juxtaposition of hot and cold elements in every bite.
